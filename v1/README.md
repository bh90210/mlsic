# How to get started

First take a look in the `/example/` directory for a quick high use example of the module.

#### Go

You need [Go 1.19 installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your system.

#### PortAudio

You also need [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) installed.

On Debian based linux distors you can do `apt install portaudio19-dev`.

On MacOS you can use Hoembrew `brew install portaudio`.

Alternatively under `/render` you will find a wav and aiff renderer for 100% offline audio generation.

#### Dot cli

If you wish to render SVG files out of your generated graphs (see `/generator`) you will need Graphviz Dot [cli installed](https://graphviz.org/download/).
